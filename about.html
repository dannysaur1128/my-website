    <h3>About Me</h3>

   <p>
        Welcome to my About Me page! My name is Daniel Joung, and I am currently a 4th-year student at 
        <b>Northeastern University</b> majoring in <b>Finance</b> with a minor in <b>Data Science</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout my time at Northeastern, I have had the privilege to complete two different co-ops. My first co-op 
        was at <b>Samsung Electronics</b> where I worked as a Data Analyst. I gained valuable experience in data 
        analysis and forecasting/budgeting processes with softwares such as Excel and SAP. My second co-op was at 
        <b>MFS Investment Management</b>, where I worked as a Corporate Financial Systems Analyst. I utilized financial
        softwares such as Hyperion, Revport, and Excel to streamline corporate finance team activities that cross-sect
        with technology. Throughout these experiences I gained many valuable skillsets that I can apply in the corporate world. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in either <b>investment management</b> or <b>corporate finance</b>. 
        I am highly passionate about financial markets and love analyzing companies from a fundamental and financial 
        standpoint. In my free time, I stay active by going to the gym, playing basketball, and rock climbing. 
        Additionally, I am training for a half marathon in May 2025 and hopefully aiming to finish near 1 hour 30 mins. 
    </p>
