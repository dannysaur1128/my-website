    <h3>A subtitle</h3>

    <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Joung, and I am currently a 4th year student at Northeastern University majoring in Finance and minoring in Data Science. 
      Currently on track to graduate in May of 2025 so super excited for that as well! I am interested in financial markets and performing financial analysis, 
      currently on job search for careers either in investment management or internal finances like FPA/corporate finance. I chose data science and finance 
      because of the combination of mathematics and data analysis really correlate into these sectors of studies which really excites me a lot! I've worked in 
      various corporate settings from Samsung in my first co-op and then MFS Investment Management for my 2nd co-op and currently on search for a full time 
      hopefully by the end of the summer! Asides from professional studies, I am a very active person physically and I was in Varsity soccer and track throughout 
      high school for 4 consecutive years. I do intramural soccer here and there, but currently I am very into basketball, lifting, and rock climbing! I am also prepping 
      to run a half marathon in early May hoping to get a time near 1 hour and 30 minutes so super excited for that. Hope this gives you a good picture of my interests 
      and lifestyles!  </p>
